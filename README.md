# ThinkOutLoud-VR
This repository is a Unity Plugin that allows you to record the audio of a participant in a think out loud experiment conducted in a virtual reality environment. After recording the file will either be saved locally to the headset or to a chosen server.
The Unity Package or Plugin you could import into your project can be found in the Plugins folder. 

Inside Sample Projects you can find the Move Fast application from Meta with the ThinkOutLoud Manager attached and will record the audio from the start of the game untill the user clicks the Oculus button or pauses the game. The recording will be saved locally on the headset.
